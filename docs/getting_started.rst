Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Sphinxus! This section will help you get started with using Sphinxus to create beautiful and comprehensive documentation for your projects.

Basic Setup
-----------

To get started with Sphinxus, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. Install Sphinxus using pip:

```bash
pip install sphinxus
```

3. Set up a new documentation project:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

4. Configure your `conf.py` file to use Sphinxus:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinxus',
    # other extensions
]
```

Initial Configuration
----------------------

After setting up your documentation project, you can start customizing it to suit your needs. Here are some initial configuration steps:

1. Open the `conf.py` file in your documentation project.
2. Set the project name, author, and version:

```python
project = 'My Project'
author = 'Author Name'
version = '1.0'
release = '1.0.0'
```

3. Choose a theme for your documentation:

```python
html_theme = 'alabaster'
```

4. Add any additional extensions you need:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinxus',
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
    # other extensions
]
```

5. Customize other options as needed. For example, you can set the language, add custom static files, and configure the sidebar.

Building the Documentation
---------------------------

Once you have configured your documentation project, you can build the documentation using the `sphinx-build` command. For example, to generate HTML documentation, run the following command:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html sourcedir builddir
```

This will generate the HTML documentation in the `builddir` directory. You can then open the generated HTML files in your web browser to view the documentation.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have set up your documentation project and generated the initial documentation, you can start adding content to your documentation. Refer to the other sections of this documentation for more detailed examples, tutorials, and best practices for using Sphinxus.
